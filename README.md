# Simple CLI To-Do List Manager

## Overview

This is a straightforward, console-based To-Do List Manager written in **Python**. It allows users to manage their tasks directly from the command line.

The application ensures **data persistence** by saving all tasks to a local text file (`todo.txt`), meaning your list will be available even after you close and reopen the application.

## Features

- **View Tasks (1):** Displays the current list of tasks with numbered indices.
- **Add Task (2):** Prompts the user to enter a new task and saves it immediately.
- **Remove Task (3):** Allows the user to delete a task by its index number.
